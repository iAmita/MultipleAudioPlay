# MultipleAudioPlay
It solved the issue of running I/O faced my many developers using AVAudio. I am providing a class which you can drag and drop in your project and just need to call one method.
// Need to call this method
//You can provide soundFile and alertTextmessagenas a string audio file can be from your bundle and alertTextmessage will contain a sting of your voice.
   coordinator.playAudio(soundFile: soundFile, alertTextmessage: stringMsg)
